    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently read <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/machine-learning-r">Machine Learning with
R</a>
by Brett Lantz. This is a book that provides an introduction to machine
learning using R. I really enjoyed the book and thought Lantz did an
excellent job explaining the content as well as providing many good
references and examples, which is what lead to my problem with the book.
As far as I can tell, Packt Publishing does not make its datasets
available online unless you buy the book and create a <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/support">user
account</a> which can be a
problem if you are checking the book out from the library or borrowing
the book from a friend. All of these datasets
are in the public domain but simply needed some cleaning up and
recoding to match the format in the book so I went ahead and made a
<a href="https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets">github repo</a>
to host them.</p>
